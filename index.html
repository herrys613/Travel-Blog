      Thursday - Day 1
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We landed at Marrakesh (RAK) airport Thursday night. We took a 15 minutetaxi to our hotel the Tempoo Hôtel Marrakech, After arriving, we ate some food we had brought along for supper and went straight to bed.

      Friday - Day 2
    </p>
     <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      We woke up Friday morning and started the day with a 40-minute walk to the old city (the Medina). While wandering through the narrow streets and local markets, we stopped at Tinsmiths Square – a small but lively spot where local guys were busy hammering away at copper and metal, making all kinds of cool traditional pieces right there in front of us.<br><br>

      From there, we headed to the Slat Al Azama Synagogue (10 DH entry fee), a historic Sephardic synagogue built in 1942, it showcases traditional Moroccan synagogue architecture with a central courtyard. Just a short walk away is the Marrakech Jewish Cemetery, (entrance is free, though a small donation to the cemetery guard is expected -about 10-20 DH per person are appropriate).<br><br>
      After that, we walked over to the El Badi Palace (100 DH entry fee), once a lavish 16th-century palace, now a grand set of ruins. Despite its current state, the scale of the walls and the layout still give you a sense of how impressive it once was.<br><br>

      From there, we continued to the famous Jemaa el-Fnaa Square — full of energy, street performers, market stalls, snake charmers, fresh orange juice vendors, and the buzz of Marrakech life.<br><br>
      We took a taxi back to the hotel. Later in the afternoon, we walked about 10 minutes to Mövenpick Hotel Mansour Eddahbi, where we’d be having our Shabbas meals — just to check out the route ahead of time.

      Sunday - Day 4
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">

      We made a stop at Atlas Studios in Ouarzazate — a famous film studio where movies like Gladiator and The Mummy were shot. ussaly a 3.5 hour drive from Marrakesh but due to a snowfall in the High Atlas Mountains (about a foot of snow, which is very rare in Morocco), the roads were closed.<br><br>
      So we had to reroute all the way down through Agadir, which added about 4 more hours to the drive.<br><br>

      Eventually, we reached the edge of the Merzouga Desert, where the camp had arranged a meeting point. From there, they took us in a jeep — about a 15-minute drive into the dunes — to our site, SIROCCO Luxury Camp. a beautiful glamping site in the middle of the desert.<br><br>
      We settled in, ate super that we bought along, and spent the night in a beautiful desert tent surrounded by sand dunes.
